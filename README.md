## Documentation HTML Template

This is an HTML template for documentation. You can use this template to create documentation for your WordPress themes (*or for themes for any other CMS*) or for your HTML templates. This template is built on the **Bootstrap framework** and includes a set of icons from **Font Awesome** and code highlighting from **Prism**. It is also **fully responsive** and looks good on mobile devices.

A **demo** is available at the following link: [Documentation Template](https://demo.minimalweb.net/documentation-template/). Demonstration in **Cyrillic** (Русский язык): [Documentation in Russian](https://demo.minimalweb.net/documentation-template/documentation-russian-language.html).

### Some notes:

*Compatible browsers*: This HTML documentation template is compatible with legacy browsers and all modern browsers.

*Image sizes for this template*: You can use images of any size. For demonstration purposes, I'm using images that are **1355 by 900 pixels**.

*Google fonts*: Open Sans (*300, 300 Italic, 400, 400 Italic, 600, 600 Italic, 700, 700 Italic*).
